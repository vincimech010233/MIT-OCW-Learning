# Design of a Permeable Reactive Barrier System for a Site Contaminated with Chlorinated Solvents

## Abstract

This document outlines the design of a Permeable Reactive Barrier (PRB) system for the treatment of groundwater contaminated by chlorinated solvents at an industrial site. PRB technology uses chemical reactions to degrade or immobilize contaminants as groundwater flows through a strategically placed reactive barrier in the subsurface.

## Introduction

Chlorinated solvents are common contaminants at industrial sites that can persist in the environment and cause significant adverse impacts on human health and ecosystems. Conventional remediation technologies, such as extraction and surface treatment, are often costly and disruptive. Permeable reactive barriers offer an efficient and cost-effective alternative for in situ remediation.

## Chemical Principles and Selection of Reactive Materials

The design of the PRB system is based on the chemistry of reduction of chlorinated solvents. Reactive materials, such as zero-valent iron (ZVI), are capable of reacting with chlorinated contaminants, reducing them to less harmful or harmless compounds. ZVI was selected for its proven efficacy in reducing chlorinated compounds and its durability in the subsurface.

## Technological Design and System Configuration

The barrier will be designed as a permeable zone that intersects the flow of contaminated groundwater. The system will be sized based on the site's hydrogeological characteristics and the concentration and type of contaminants present. Computational models will be used to simulate groundwater flow and chemical reaction kinetics, thereby optimizing the efficiency of the barrier.

## Implementation and Monitoring

The PRB system will require an installation phase where a trench will be excavated and filled with the reactive material. The design will include easy access for monitoring and maintenance, with sampling points along the barrier to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and the structural integrity of the barrier over time.

## Conclusions and Future Research

Implementing a PRB system for the remediation of chlorinated contaminants offers a sustainable and low-impact solution for decontaminating groundwater. Future research may focus on improving reactive materials and installation techniques to enhance the efficiency and reduce the costs of PRB systems.
